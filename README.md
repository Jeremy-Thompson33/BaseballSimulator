## ⚾ Baseball Simulator
##### 🧑‍💻 **By Jeremy Thompson**
### 📖 Project Overview
This project is a baseball simulation engine that models offensive production for a given MLB lineup. The model uses live player data to improve simulation accuracy and usefulness throughout the season. By using the simulator, important strategic questions can be answered for individual teams and for the MLB as a whole. 

I built this to combine my interests in sports analytics, probability modeling, and algorithm design — while also showcasing practical skills in Python, web scraping, data structures, and optimization techniques.
